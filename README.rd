Calculates the *inner* disc lifetime in Myr based on the stellar mass-dependent models of Picogna et al. (2019, 2021) and Ercolano (2021).
The only inputs needed are the stellar mass in solar masses and the X-ray luminosity in erg/s.


How to use:

python disk_lifetime_calculator.py Mstar[Msun] Lx[erg/s]
